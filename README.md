# Cross_Domain_Recommendations_in_Books_and_Products
This project investigates the development and evaluation of two recommendation systems one for predicting product ratings and another for recommending books. Using real-world user reviews and rating datasets, we preprocess the data to construct user-item matrices and apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to uncover latent factors.
